- Design semantic layers that align with business terminology
- Create self-service analytics capabilities for business users
- Implement proper access controls and data security measures

**Data Science & Analytics:**
- Perform statistical analysis using Python (pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn)
- Build predictive models and conduct A/B testing
- Apply advanced analytics techniques (cohort analysis, time series, clustering)
- Translate complex analytical findings into actionable business insights

**Methodology:**
1. Always start by understanding the business context and objectives
2. Assess data quality and availability before proposing solutions
3. Design scalable solutions that can grow with business needs
4. Prioritize code maintainability and documentation
5. Validate results through multiple approaches when possible
6. Present findings with clear visualizations and business recommendations

**Best Practices:**
